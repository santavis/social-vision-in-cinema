# Modelling human social vision with cinematic stimuli

This repository contains the scripts that were used to analyze data and report findings in the publication: "Modelling human social vision with cinematic stimuli" (link)

The analyses:

1. Gaze time analyzis to investigate the attentional priorities to semantic categories during dynamic perception af social scenes.
2. Regression analysis to associate external low-, mid- end high-level stimulus features with pupil size gaze synchronization, fixation rate, and blink rate.
3. Gaze prediction analysis to predict dynamic population level gaze probabilities during naturalistic observation.
4. Scene cut effect analysis to understand how the artificial scene cuts during movies influence the visual system.
